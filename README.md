Mathematical Components Analaysis
====

## Contents

This repository contains a library for real analysis based on
an interface of real numbers](https://github.com/strub/coq-alternate-reals) for the *C*oq proof-assistant
using the Mathematical Components library. It is inspired by the
[Coquelicot library](http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/). The
instantiation of the mathematical structures of the Mathematical
Components library with the real numbers of the standard Coq library
uses a well-known file (Rstruct.v) from the [CoqApprox library](http://tamadi.gforge.inria.fr/CoqApprox/) (with modifications from various authors).
