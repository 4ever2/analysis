## Contents

This repository contains a library for real *A*nalysis based on
*A*lternate version of *R*eal numbers for the *C*oq proof-assistant
using the Mathematical Components library. It is inspired by the
Coquelicot library (http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/). The
instantiation of the mathematical structures of the Mathematical
Components library with the real numbers of the standard Coq library
uses a well-known file (Rstruct.v) from the CoqApprox library
(http://tamadi.gforge.inria.fr/CoqApprox/).
